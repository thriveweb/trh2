    A Pre-purchase examination (PPE) is normally carried out in five stages
    (although all stages may not be completed if a problem is evident at an
    early stage).  A basic two stage pre-purchase exam may also be requested.

      Firstly, a detailed history of the horse is obtained from the vendor /
      agent.  The identification of the horse is checked against documentation.
      The horse is then examined at rest and physical examination is undertaken.
      The eyes are examined in a darkened stable with an ophthalmoscope and the
      heart is listened to on both sides of the chest. The front teeth
      (incisors) are checked to ensure the approximate age of the horse matches
      documentation. A detailed musculoskeletal examination is performed. The
      limb joints are palpated for evidence of joint effusion, soft tissue
      swelling, enlargement, range of motion and pain. The prominent tendon and
      ligament structures of the pastern and cannon and upper limb regions are
      palpated for swelling, heat and pain and evidence of previous injury. 
      Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory system and a brief
      neurological examination are performed. The back is assessed for muscular
      and vertebral pain and the range of the thoraco-lumbar and sacroiliac
      regions. Foot examination considered foot size, shape and symmetry as well
      as heel support. The horse is checked over for any abnormalities, such as
      lumps and scars, and these will be recorded.
    title: 'Stage 1: Preliminary Examination'
  - content: >-
      This phase includes assessment of the horse standing square, walking and
      trotting in a straight line, being backed up for several strides and
      performing tight turns on both reins. This takes place on a on a firm,
      level surface if possible.

       Flexion tests are then performed, where the leg is held up for 45-60 seconds and the horse is trotted away in a straight line. A flexion test is considered positive if the horse takes more than 3-5 steps to return to a normal gait. A positive flexion test could indicate a problem with a joint and/or soft tissue structure and will be considered along with the rest of the examination.  

      Lunging on both reins on a firm or sand arena commonly performed.
    title: 'Stage 2: Walk and trot, in hand'
  - content: >-
      This phase is usually performed in saddle and the aim is to give
      sufficient exercise to assess the horse when it has an increased breathing
      effort and heart rate. The horse’s gait should assessed at walk, trot,
      canter, and if appropriate, the horse’s discipline. Any abnormal behaviour
      seen during this phase should is noted and discussed with the purchaser. 


      Abnormal breathing sounds may indicate an airway problem that could impair
      athletic ability. This stage needs to be tailored to suit the horse and
      its intended purpose.
    title: 'Stage 3: Exercise Phase'
  - content: >-
      The horse is returned to the stable and the saddle and tack removed. The
      heart and lungs are assessed as the horse recovers from the exercise
      phase. The horse’s normal behaviour in the stable can be observed again
      and some vices may be displayed after exercise so may be observed during
      this time.
    title: 'Stage 4: Period of Rest and Re-examination'
  - content: >-
      The final stage involves trotting the horse up in hand again. This is to
      assess any changes or lameness that may have arisen from the exercise or
      recovery phases.
    title: 'Stage 5: Second Trot Up '

      In some cases it may be necessary to perform additional examinations –
      radiographs and  ultrasound examination of tendons or ligaments, or
      carrying out endoscopic examination of the upper airways. These procedures
      may only be undertaken with the consent of the current owner and will
      incur additional costs to the buyer.

      A blood sample can to be taken to assess for any current medical
      conditions as well as stored or assessed for the presence of medications.
