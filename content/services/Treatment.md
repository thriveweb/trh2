  subtitle: "Platelet rich plasma is a therapy for the treatment of equine joint, tendon, ligament and bursae injuries. It is a welcome addition to the range of therapies available to treat these injuries because it offers an affordable, practical and scientifically based point of care treatment alternative to horse owners and trainers alike. Platelets are small cell fragments that circulate in the blood. A sample of blood is taken from the horse  and processed to increase the number of platelets and growth factors it contains. This is done by passing the blood through a filter.  The PRP sample can be ready to inject into the horse within 30 minutes after taking the blood sample. \r\n\nPlatelets release a large number of growth factors when they arrive at a site of tissue injury, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), insulin-like growth factors (IGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) that are known to orchestrate the movements of other cells and stimulate the production of repair tissue (extracellular matrix). This aids in speeding the recovery process and improves the end result."
