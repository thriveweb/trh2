  subtitle: "A regular program of dentistry is essential for all ages of horse. Regular oral examination and dentistry will allow the detection and removal of sharp enamel points that develop due to continued eruption of equine teeth.\r\n\nRegular examination will enable us to detect the early signs of abnormalities in the wear of cheek teeth, irregularities in eruption, decay and periodontal disease. We can also detect and correct problems with bitting, head carriage, performance and eating disorders. We use a modern, motorised ‘Powerfloat’ at the clinic to allow rapid and thorough completion of dentistry services."
