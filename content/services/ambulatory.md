    Our recommendation, is that all horses are routinely vaccinated against
    tetanus and strangles. Both of these diseases are reasonably common and both
    can be severe or fatal. When regular boosters are given, protection
    following vaccination is generally excellent and will prevent illness or at
    the very least, reduce the severity of clinical signs and/or the duration of
    illne

It is a lethal disease which can spread from horses to people. It is present in flying foxes and has clinically spread to horses (and has also spread to a dog from a horse). The virus has been transmitted from horses to humans. The virus can be transmitted from horse to horse, but has not been shown to spread from human to human at this stage. Infection appears to occur through contact with bodily fluids of an infected being.\r\n\nSYMPTOMS OF POSSIBLE HENDRA VIRUS INFECTION (As stated by the Australian Veterinary Association):\r\n\n“Clinical signs of Hendra virus infection are varied, vague and similar to many common equine ailments that veterinarians encounter on a daily basis. The Queensland government’s Guidelines for veterinarians handling potential Hendra virus infection in horses states that Hendra virus infection should be considered if a horse may have had contact with flying foxes and any one or combination of the following signs are present:\r\n\nAcute illness\r\n\nIncreased temperature\r\n\nIncreased heart rate\r\n\nDiscomfort or shifting weight between legs\r\n\nDepression or rapid deterioration in health\r\n\nHorses with confirmed Hendra virus infection have also presented with respiratory, colic, or neurologic signs, weakness, inappetence or behaviour change.\r\n\nEssentially this indicates that almost any unvaccinated sick horse with potential exposure to flying fox excretions, virus-contaminated objects or other horses may have a Hendra virus infection.”"

  - content: "Equine herpesvirus (EHV) is both clinically and economically important worldwide. Currently there are nine different herpesviruses that are recognised (EHV-1 to EHV-9). However, the most significant types are EHV-1 and EHV-4.\r\n\n \r\n\nThe virus is endemic within the horse population in most countries throughout the world. EHV-1 is the most significant of the equine herpesviruses, as it is responsible for causing respiratory disease, abortion (including outbreaks), early neonatal death of foals and neurologic disease. However, EHV-4 is also associated with respiratory disease and, less commonly, abortion. In any given outbreak of EHV, clinical signs are usually limited to one manifestation of the disease."
