    Our recommendation, is that all horses are routinely vaccinated against
    tetanus and strangles. Both of these diseases are reasonably common and both
    can be severe or fatal. When regular boosters are given, protection
    following vaccination is generally excellent and will prevent illness or at
    the very least, reduce the severity of clinical signs and/or the duration of
    illne

      **WHAT IS HENDRA VIRUS?**


      The Hendra Virus (HeV) was first discovered in 1994 in the Brisbane
      district of Hendra. It is a lethal disease which can spread from horses to
      people. It is present in flying foxes and has clinically spread to horses
      (and has also spread to a dog from a horse). The virus has been
      transmitted from horses to humans. The virus can be transmitted from horse
      to horse, but has not been shown to spread from human to human at this
      stage. Infection appears to occur through contact with bodily fluids of an
      infected being.


      **SYMPTOMS OF POSSIBLE HENDRA VIRUS INFECTION** (As stated by the
      Australian Veterinary Association):


      “Clinical signs of Hendra virus infection are varied, vague and similar to
      many common equine ailments that veterinarians encounter on a daily basis.
      The Queensland government’s Guidelines for veterinarians handling
      potential Hendra virus infection in horses states that Hendra virus
      infection should be considered if a horse may have had contact with flying
      foxes and any one or combination of the following signs are present:


      * Acute illness

      * Increased temperature

      * Increased heart rate

      * Discomfort or shifting weight between legs

      * Depression or rapid deterioration in health


      Horses with confirmed Hendra virus infection have also presented with
      respiratory, colic, or neurologic signs, weakness, inappetence or
      behaviour change.


      Essentially this indicates that almost any unvaccinated sick horse with
      potential exposure to flying fox excretions, virus-contaminated objects or
      other horses may have a Hendra virus infection.”

  - content: "Equine herpesvirus (EHV) is both clinically and economically important worldwide. Currently there are nine different herpesviruses that are recognised (EHV-1 to EHV-9). However, the most significant types are EHV-1 and EHV-4.\r\n\n \r\n\nThe virus is endemic within the horse population in most countries throughout the world. EHV-1 is the most significant of the equine herpesviruses, as it is responsible for causing respiratory disease, abortion (including outbreaks), early neonatal death of foals and neurologic disease. However, EHV-4 is also associated with respiratory disease and, less commonly, abortion. In any given outbreak of EHV, clinical signs are usually limited to one manifestation of the disease."

      A regular program of dentistry is essential for all ages of horse. Regular
      oral examination and dentistry will allow the detection and removal of
      sharp enamel points that develop due to continued eruption of equine
      teeth.\r\n\nRegular examination will enable us to detect the early signs
      of abnormalities in the wear of cheek teeth, irregularities in eruption,
      decay and periodontal disease. We can also detect and correct problems
      with bitting, head carriage, performance and eating disorders. We use a
      modern, motorised ‘Powerfloat’ at the clinic to allow rapid and thorough
      completion of dentistry services.

      We cannot stress enough that problems with the eye are one of those
      ailments which must be checked by a vet immediately.


      If your horse’s eye/s show the following symptoms, we strongly urge you to
      call a vet as soon as possible:


      * weeping, tears that are clear

      * discharge of any other colour, or consistency

      * swelling of or around the eye

      * sensitivity to light or touch

      * blinking strangley, or keeping the eye closed

      * white or other coloured spots/patches on the eye/cloudiness

      * Lines or marks across the eye

      * bleeding from the eye

      * redness in or around the eye

      * constricted/odd-looking pupils


      Eyes are a very delicate organ. Self medicating with what might seem like
      an innocuous cream can do more harm than good, and can result in the eye
      becoming infected or even rupturing. When the eye ruptures in many cases
      it has to be surgically removed.


      To diagnose an eye complaint your vet would examine the eye with a light.
      They usually would then stain it with fluroscein to determine the severity
      and depth of the ulcer. If the vet fears that the ulcer is infected they
      make take a swab to culture.


      Depending on the diagnosis and severity, your vet may treat with a number
      of prescription eye ointments, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and even
      in some severe cases, eye surgery.  To try and avoid such a costly and
      stressful outcome, we always advise to get a vet at the first sign of a
      problem with the eye.
