    Ultrasonography is an imaging modality used to assess soft tissue structures
    such as tendons, ligaments, internal organs, eyes and masses. Damage to
    tendons and ligaments can be seen on ultrasound as changes to the fibre
    pattern and cross sectional area of the structure. Ultrasound is used
    rectally in mares to assess the uterus and ovaries as well as checking for
    pregnancy during their breeding cycle. TRH Equine Veterinary Services has a
    high quality soft tissue ultrasound as well reproduction ultrasound for
    mobile use, allowing us to perform thorough ultrasound exams in the stables
    and field.
