    Endoscopy is the process by which a long fiberoptic camera is used to
    visualise the equine respiratory tract. Using this camera we can visualise
    the pharynx, larynx, guttural pouches and trachea in great detail and take
    biopsy samples for laboratory testing if required. We have three fibrescope
    endoscopes which can be used in a stable without a power source. Endoscopy
    is an essential part of evaluating horses with upper airway disease,
    abnormal respiratory noise and lung disease. The equine urinary tract and
    uterus can also be visualised with the use of an endoscope. By inserting the
    camera into the horse’s urethra or uterus we can visualise the insides of
    these organs and take biopsies if required for diagnostic testing.

      Gastroscopy is the use of a special three meter long video endoscope which
      allows us to visualise and assess the equine stomach. Equine gastric ulcer
      syndrome (EGUS) can present with a number of different symptoms, low grade
      colic, weight loss, changes in attitude and behaviour, sub optimal
      performance, dull coat and many other vague signs of ill health.
      Gastroscopy allows rapid and accurate evaluation of the horse’s stomach
      lining and therefore an instant diagnosis as to whether the horse is
      suffering from ulcers. If gastric ulcers are found in the stomach our
      veterinarians can then tailor a treatment program specific to your horse’s
      needs and track progress through rescoping of the stomach. Horses for
      gastroscopy need to be fasted for 12 hours prior to assessment. This gives
      time for the stomach to empty completely so that the entire stomach lining
      can be visualised during the scoping procedure. On booking your
      appointment one of our team members will run through the steps with you in
      preparing your horse for its gastroscopy appointment.
