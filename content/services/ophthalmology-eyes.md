  subtitle: "We cannot stress enough that problems with the eye are one of those ailments which must be checked by a vet immediately.\r\n\nIf your horseâ€™s eye/s show the following symptoms, we strongly urge you to call a vet as soon as possible:\r\n\n\r\n\n \r\n\nweeping, tears that are clear\r\n\ndischarge of any other colour, or consistency\r\n\nswelling of or around the eye\r\n\nsensitivity to light or touch\r\n\nblinking strangley, or keeping the eye closed\r\n\nwhite or other coloured spots/patches on the eye/cloudiness\r\n\nLines or marks across the eye\r\n\nbleeding from the eye\r\n\nredness in or around the eye\r\n\nconstricted/odd-looking pupils\r\n\nEyes are a very delicate organ. Self medicating with what might seem like an innocuous cream can do more harm than good, and can result in the eye becoming infected or even rupturing. When the eye ruptures in many cases it has to be surgically removed.\r\n\nTo diagnose an eye complaint your vet would examine the eye with a light. They usually would then stain it with fluroscein to determine the severity and depth of the ulcer. If the vet fears that the ulcer is infected they make take a swab to culture.\r\n\nDepending on the diagnosis and severity, your vet may treat with a number of prescription eye ointments, antibiotics, antinflamatories, and even in some severe cases, eye surgery.  To try and avoid such a costly and stressful outcome, we always advise to get a vet at the first sign of a problem with the eye."
