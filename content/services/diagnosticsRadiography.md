    Radiography is the main imaging modality for the assessment of bone and bone
    structure. TRH Equine Veterinary Services uses the very latest in digital
    computer radiography systems which produces radiographic images of excellent
    quality. The pictures are viewed on a computer screen and areas of
    particular interest can be focussed on to achieve more detail. This system
    allows us to easily send digital copies of your xrays. The system we have is
    fully portable allowing us to obtain high quality xray images at your
    property.

      Ultrasonography is an imaging modality used to assess soft tissue
      structures such as tendons, ligaments, internal organs, eyes and masses.
      Damage to tendons and ligaments can be seen on ultrasound as changes to
      the fibre pattern and cross sectional area of the structure. Ultrasound is
      used rectally in mares to assess the uterus and ovaries as well as
      checking for pregnancy during their breeding cycle. TRH Equine Veterinary
      Services has a high quality soft tissue ultrasound as well reproduction
      ultrasound for mobile use, allowing us to perform thorough ultrasound
      exams in the stables and field.
