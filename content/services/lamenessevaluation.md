  subtitle: "Our vets can carry out lameness examinations at your property, where they will examine your horse, watch it walk and carry out joint palpation and flexion to assess which limb or limbs are involved. They may then request to see the horse being trotted up, lunged or ridden. If it is immediately apparent what is causing the lameness (e.g. a wound, penetration injury, etc.), the vet will be able to advise on the most appropriate treatment.\r\n\nOther cases may require nerve blocks to localise the site of pain, combined with diagnostic imaging (using portable radiography or ultrasonography) in order for the vet to determine the structures involved and diagnose the cause of the lameness. The vet will then recommend appropriate management and/or treatment and give a prognosis for the injury.\r\n\nMore complex lameness cases may require an in-depth investigation."
